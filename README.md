# mamba-nd

NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED

The plan is to implement n-dimensional mamba in this repo.

Basic model will be built on this implementation of [MambaByte](https://github.com/kyegomez/MambaByte/tree/main)

The goal is to implement the basic algorithm in the paper [Mamba-ND: Selective State Space Modeling for
Multi-Dimensional Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05892.pdf) and then make a few simple examples.
